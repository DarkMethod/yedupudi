# Yedupudi
Yedupudi is a result of like minded Non-Resident Indians from Tamil Nadu who faced a lot of issues in starting and completing tasks in India in their absence.
The need was for an entity that could be trusted to take care of tasks very important and personal to them, like managing the health of their aged parents or monitoring the education of their children in colleges or building their dream house.
